## GNU Radio FM Decoder

The goal of this little project is to demonstrate FM broadcast radio
demodulation, including the baseband data beyond the mono-audio channel,
for students.

Also, something to keep me busy and having fun while I'm recovering from
foot surgery.

There will be more documentation to come and clean-up of the GRC file and
other assorted source files. I like to keep a clean house.
